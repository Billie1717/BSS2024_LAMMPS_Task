Billie & Chris tasks

-Easiest way to have people accessing LAMMPS? 
    I think there is no way to use lammps without downloading the src code. 
    Hopefully this should be fine with 12 people per group - if we have instructions for downloading (like in np-toolkit) then 1 person will manage

-take the flat membrane
-comment the file 
-set task - patchy particle being engulfed
-make sure there is enough time on the simulations


-Fix epsilon = 10? 15?
-Allow positions to change (comment them)


Description of task:

- What is the most efficient placement of 24 patches on a nanoparticle for a flat membrane to engulf the nanoparticle? 

Hints:
- Useful to be able to do statistics. Trajectories can be analysed using Ovito tools (put example of 'wrapping.py' script?
- It may be useful to do multiple random seeds of the same initial conditions
- Patch positions are specified in /data/sp-data.data after the 'Atoms' header. It has the format :
ID Type x y z . . . vx vy vz
1 1 -20.745 8.71864 -0.0204975 1 1 0 0.0439223 -0.0189721 0.998855

All particles of type > 2 are patches. They are placed on the sphere which is type 3 and has radius 4

Bonus :
-You can also change their interactions wrt one another, but their total interaction (sum of epsilon's) cannot exceed 24x15=600
